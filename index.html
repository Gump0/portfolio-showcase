                        <i>"Don't Get Hooked!"</i> is a result of a week-long game jam, where developers are grouped together at random
                        to create a game based on a single <i>prompt</i>. This game's prompt being a "microgame", required participants to make a game that is restricted to a maximum play time of <b>30 seconds</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        As a group we collectively developed a 2D <i>bullet hell</i> microgame, where the player is challenged to survive for 30 seconds to achieve the game's win condition,
                        otherwise the game will end prematurely.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        As the <b>programmer</b> on the team, I was charged with creating the game's various systems using <i>Unity's</i>
                        built in <b>C#</b> scripting framework.

                    <p>
                        Countless times throughout my game development journey I have found myself building numerous menu interfaces for my personal projects.
                        So one day I thought, <i>maybe I can make this easier for myself?</i>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Here I have my beloved <i>modular user interface framework</i>, a <i>Unity</i> project that can easily be transferred into another.
                        Allowing to easily create a basic user menu system as fast as possible, including a built-in custom keyboard/controller support.               
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        This project features basic menu interfaces and navigation, designed to be as <b>modular</b> as possible. Where every visual and scriptable component can
                        easily be replaced, modified and tuned to any project's specific circumstances.

                    <i>City Swerving</i> is a 2D endless runner game developed as a group fully within the <i>Unity</i> game engine.
                    As the groups lead programmer, I was in charge for writing the entire games code using <b>C#</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                    The game was designed with the intention of creating a chaotic arcade-like experience with one simple goal.
                    To swim in traffic for as long as possible without crashing your vehicle.
                <br>
                <br>
                The game was prototyped within a two week sprint and continued development for a few months as a fun group class project.
                Throughout development we have placed great emphasis on conducting numerous play sessions with anonymous playtesters to ensure that <i>City Swerving</i> was continuously heading in the right direction.
                As of now the game is no longer in development but is available to play on <b>Itch.io!</b>
